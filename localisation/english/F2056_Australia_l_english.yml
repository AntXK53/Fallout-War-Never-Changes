    australia_news.2.desc:0 "For the past seven years in Australia, there has been bushfires occuring almost every month, with the already collasped nation being at a standstill between the newly independent factions of Australia.

    AUS_events.3_desc:0 "Prime Minister Bennett Daniel, Leader of the Liberal Party was elected in a time of crisis, promising hope, recovery, and leadership to steer Australia through the looming storm. But from day one, his policies have only deepened the country's wounds. The environmental crises were ignored, corporate interests flourished unchecked, and the once-strong national unity fractured. Under his rule, Australia’s economy collapsed, corruption spread through the halls of power, and flames of rebellion grew and collapsed the nation. His government's failure is now undeniable, and with unrest growing, the Prime Minister today announced that he will step down and hold a general election."
