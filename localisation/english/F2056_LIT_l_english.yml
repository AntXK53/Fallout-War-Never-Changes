 LIT_claims_on_poland_idea: "Claims to Polish Lands"
 LIT_claims_on_poland_idea_desc: "§y"The best defense is a good offense."§! \n\nThis is often said, justifying aggression as a means of defense against another aggressor. And in order to resist Russian imperialism, Lithuania needs to increase its influence and power. How to achieve this? Remember the past - namely the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which once included lands that are now in Poland. Although we do not declare official aggression against Poland, we still continue to lay claim to Białystok and other territories that rightfully belong to us. What could go wrong?"
