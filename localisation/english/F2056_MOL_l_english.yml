 MOL_legacy_of_lenins_revolution_desc:0 "Great Leader Lenin ignited the Great Revolution nearly a century ago! Yet the noble ideals of our Leader have decayed under the rot of the new Soviet regime. Since Lenin's passing, his legacy has been eroded and distorted, betrayed by those who strayed from his vision. Now, as the Soviet legacy teeters on the brink of collapse, we rise to reignite the flame of revolution! For Lenin's true ideals - no matter the cost, no matter the blood spilled - we shall resurrect the mighty USSR, purified by the spirit of our Leader! The time has come to reclaim what was lost, even if it demands sacrifice. Lenin's dream §twill endure§!."
