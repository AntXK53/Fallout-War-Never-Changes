## EVENTS

congress_summons_doa.t: "Congress Summons Department Of Agriculture"
congress_summons_doa.d: "[congress_doa_loc]"
congress_summons_doa_coalition.d: "A newsman spoke from outside the Capitol building. He repeated the words the press had heard hours earlier: \"Today, Congress is holding an investigative hearing. They learned that over 70 billion dollars were spent on a mysterious program in the Department of Agriculture.\" The camera shifts over to focus on a man exiting his car and walking towards the Capitol building. \"There he is— Mr. Eckhart, secretary of the department. He and other key figures in the department will appear.\" \n\nThirty minutes later, the hearing starts, Senator Sam Blackwell, true to form, asked many questions during the hearing. It was clear even before the hearing began that he would lead any investigation if needed. And those rumors were confirmed when Congress voted to create a committee to investigate the budget. The camera's shutter every time Eckhart spoke or took a document from his briefcase. "

It was clear even before the hearing began that he would lead any investigation if needed. And those rumors were confirmed when Congress voted to create a committee to investigate the budget. The camera's shutter every time Eckhart spoke or took a document from his briefcase. Later that night Eckhart was seen meeting with the president in the White house."
congress_summons_doa.1.a: "Mr. Eckhart?"

revelations.t: "Revelations"
revelations.d: "Sam and the rest of the committee had expected that someone had lazily misplaced a decimal, or maybe there was fraud. And then they reached out ot the secretary of agriculture, who nervously answered the call. \"Hi, this is Sam Blackwell from the congressional committee. Did you know about the 76.4 billion dollars that were going to your department?\" The secretary interrupted him, \"Yes, we are uh, looking into this ourselves, don't worry.\"  Sam furled his brow and leaned back in his chair, \"Uh-huh, well that's fine, but we will investigate this ourselves, hopefully you can cooperate with us.\" The secretary paused for a moment, but didn't feel like just a moment. \"Well, the funding was uh, just for a simple government continuity program.\" \"An undisclosed one? And what the hell is the Department of Agriculture doing preserving the government?\" His voice got louder as he asked the question, but the secretary only got quieter. \"Well, uh, the government will need food to be stored and ready to harvest and uh, that costs money...\" The lights in Sam's room buzz as neither of them speaks, and before Sam can end the call with a kind goodbye, the phone on the other end clicks into its receiver."
revelations.1.a: "Well, that was strange."

mr_secretary.t: "Mr. Secretary?"
mr_secretary.d: "[mr_secretary_loc]"
mr_secretary_enclave.d: "\"Hello? Mr Secretary?\" The committee was now knocking on his door. His desk, littered with documents that would destroy him. \"No not just him but the entire damn Enclave.\" He thought to himself as he scrambled to hide letters to the president — commands to build vaults — \"Yes, you can come in, take a seat.\" A bead of sweat ran down his forehead. \"How are you, gentleman?\" None of the members responded; instead, they cut straight to business. \"Well, we all thought it was a little bit strange that your department would be heading the government in case of emergency, so we did some digging. Mail straight to the president, and even a few to Vault-Tec.\" How did they find out? He thought about all the things he had done to make sure that no one could find out. \"So what are you doing with Vault-Tec? We read some of it, it doesn't seem so much like a government continuity program as someone asking for a place to hide.\""

revelationstwo.d: "[revelationstwo_loc]"
revelationstwo_enclave.d: "The committee had now secured a warrant to search the entire Department of Agriculture's offices. Police officers opened cabinets crammed with files that detailed everything from planting zones to plans for congressional bunkers. They uncovered letters exchanged with Vault-Tec, Big MT, RobCo, and Poseidon Energy. Outside, a growing crowd of reporters gathered on the sidewalk, their cameras ready, eager to capture the unfolding drama."

the_crossing_of_the_rubicon.d: "President Granite and the General of the Army had hidden themselves in the situation room. The general paced, \"Are you sure that Eckhart won't fold?\" Not looking away from the broadcast. \"He's too proud to do that. He'll go down fighting with us.\"  The general stopped his pacing. \"Well then, it's decided.\""

and_the_veil_comes_down.t: "And The Veil Is Down"
and_the_veil_comes_down.d: "The newsman started his broadcast, \"President [USA.GetLeader] stated he was infuriated and would take action immediately, but he hasn't commented on that. The information released to the press has told us one thing: A conspiracy exists to create a deep state following a national emergency. Leaked internal documents are headed with \"Enclave Only.\" Thomas Eckhart has been placed under arrest and is being trialed for treason — for the first time in centuries — not only him, but the rest of the 'Enclave'\" \n\nThe newsman listened in the Capitol building as Congress awaited the committee's report on the situation. The building is enraged, and members speak over each other. \"In part of the search of Mr. Eckharts' offices, we found letters to President Oswald,\" Blackwell took a breath, \"who was compliant in the creation of the Enclave and was one of the founders of the Enclave.\" Several senators and representatives now face treason charges. But behind it all, the true backing came from the corporations and the military. The CEOS of Vault-Tec and Big MT have been placed under significant scrutiny for their involvement in the scandal. \n\nThe jury finds you..."
